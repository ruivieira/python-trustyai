Welcome to TrustyAI's documentation!
====================================
Red Hat's TrustyAI-Python library provides XAI explanations of decision services and
predictive models for both enterprise and data science use-cases.

This library is designed to provide a set of Python bindings to the main
`TrustyAI Java toolkit <https://github.com/trustyai-explainability/trustyai-explainability>`_, to allow
for easier access to the toolkit in data science and prototyping use cases. This means the library
benefits from both the speed of Java as well as the ease-of-use of Python; our whitepaper shows that
the TrustyAI-Python LIME and SHAP explainers can run faster than the the official implementations.
